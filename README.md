## An all in one solution to a fully-functioning, no-profit grocery store.

### ❓ What is necessities?
#### tl;dr A hopeful project to help create an affordable planet by offering good food as cheap as possible.

Necessities is an ambitious project to create a fully-featured suite of software, guides, SOPs and resources to open a one-of-a-kind grocery store that calculates the exact margin to keep the doors open and the staff paid, but not a penny more.

### 🤔 How is this supposed to work?
Ideally, this is a package so that any community can open their own grocery store, in the perfect version, we'd also include marketing and fundraising tools so that the store can be owned by the people who are actually going to shop there daily.
The idea is for people to invest in their own community and neighborhood and keeping more of their money in their own town instead of to whatever supermarket conglomerate is in their area.

By having tools for inventory, POS, business administration, HR and timekeeping all under the same software, an algorithim will determine exactly how much profit needs to be made on any item in order to keep the staff with a living wage, the lights on and the morgage paid. (No executive yacht included)
The daily (or perhaps even hourly) price margin and total store expenses will be on display at all times, so you don't have to wonder where your money is actually going.

### 🏃 I'm in, how can I help; what's the plan of attack?
So far, this repository is mostly empty - this idea has lived in my head for years and I've slowly been gaining experience in POS, business management, tax code, inventory and other relevant fields and I feel like I'm at a good place to begin. If you want to help, I'm just a dude 🤷, so send me a message! I'm available during business hours for the most part (flexible day-job) so let's jump on a call and colaborate!

# Roadmap
## Present - April 2024
- Begin process of uploading all database schemas into a readable form and brainstorm with data scientists about how best to organize the databases
- Begin inventory software! (The inventory is the backbone of the system and will need to be robust!)
- - Python backend
- - Confirm language for frontend, though all frontend will likely be placeholder for now
- - Create feature list for inventory system!

## Future
### Inventory
- Push inventory
- Retrieve inventory
- Add counts
- Create different quantities (case, pack, pallet)
- All quantities need to be editable
- Create API for inventory

### POS
- Add items to cart
- Pull price from central database
- Manual price adjust

### Business Admin
- Add fixed expenses like morgage payment
- Add fluid expenses like water and power bill
- Research relevant tax documents (State and county/borough)
- Contracts

### HR
- Add Employees
- Edit Employees (name, phone number, gender identity and address change)
- Record of timekeeping
- Payroll
- Benefits (Ability to edit)

### Feature creep!
- Membership (individuals or investors who live in the area get a different margin than visitors)


## Past
### September 2022
- Initial idea

### March 2024
- Offically began project!
- Added this snazzy readme
- Outlined for the future
