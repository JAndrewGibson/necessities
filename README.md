# An all in one solution to a fully-functioning, no-profit grocery store.

### ‚ùì What is necessities?
#### tl;dr A hopeful project to help create an affordable planet by offering good food as cheap as possible.

Necessities is an ambitious project to create a fully-featured suite of software, guides, SOPs and resources to open a one-of-a-kind grocery store that calculates the exact margin to keep the doors open and the staff paid, but not a penny more.

### ü§î How is this supposed to work?
Ideally, this is a package so that any community can open their own grocery store, in the perfect version, we'd also include marketing and fundraising tools so that the store can be owned by the people who are actually going to shop there daily.
The idea is for people to invest in their own community and neighborhood and keeping more of their money in their own town instead of to whatever supermarket conglomerate is in their area.

By having tools for inventory, POS, business administration, HR and timekeeping all under the same software, an algorithim will determine exactly how much profit needs to be made on any item in order to keep the staff with a living wage, the lights on and the morgage paid. (No executive yacht included)
The daily (or perhaps even hourly) price margin and total store expenses will be on display at all times, so you don't have to wonder where your money is actually going.

### üèÉ [I'm in, how can I help; what's the plan of attack?](https://github.com/JAndrewGibson/necessities/)
So far, [this repository](https://github.com/JAndrewGibson/necessities/) is mostly empty - this idea has lived in my head for years and I've slowly been gaining experience in POS, business management, tax code, inventory and other relevant fields and I feel like I'm at a good place to begin. If you want to help, I'm just a dude ü§∑, so [send me a message!](mailto:agibson@hondacenter.com) I'm available during business hours for the most part (flexible day-job) so let's jump on a call and colaborate!
